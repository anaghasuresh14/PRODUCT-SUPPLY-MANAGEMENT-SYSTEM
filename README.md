# PRODUCT-SUPPLY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

This project focuses on managing the product supply. The products can be supplied to customers based on the availability in the product warehouse. If the product is available 
then the order can be placed by the customer. The estimated delivery speed can be provided to the customer according to their location.
